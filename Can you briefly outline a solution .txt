Can you briefly outline a solution architecture for the task below:

Generate typeScript and React ts code that achieves the following using an Object Oriented approach:


You need to create a Google Chrome extension that renders a table that authorizes user and stores user secret in encrypted in the storage:

Extension window should pop up on installation
If extension was NOT initialized before, it should generate and present to a user a new secret (secret - just a random string of a static length)
On the next screen it should ask user to provide a password with confirmation
If password matches confirmation, it should store generated secret securely using encryption
Once application is initialized, extension should ask user to log in into the application
When the user is signed in - they should see the secret. They should also have a button to regenerate the secret (it should then replace the original secret) and log out button
When user is log out, they should also have a option to reset the extension state to a new-like application
On a subsequent browser opening, extension should not open a pop up window and:
If an extension is initialized, it should face the user with either sign in page
or , if the application was doomed or initialization was not complete, it should ask the user to proceed though the initialization process again.

Other details:

Synchronization between front application and background script
Object oriented approach
create the manifest.json as well



It would take about a week to complete and compensation would be around 250Euros, this can of course be negotiated.
