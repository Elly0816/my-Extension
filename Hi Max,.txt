Hi Max,

Here is my proposed solution architecture:

A manifest file that defines the properties and permissions of the extension.
A background script that handles events such as installation, initialization and authentication of the extension.
A content script that interacts with the web page and renders the table.
An options page that allows the user to change their password.

The extension would use Chrome's storage API to store user data securely.
The extension would use encryption to store the secret.

Chrome's messaging API would handle the synchronization between the background script and the front end of the application. 
JavaScript classes would be used to implement an object-Oriented approach


It would take about a week to complete and compensation would be around 250Euros, this can of course be negotiated.
